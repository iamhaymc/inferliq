## 1. The shape of the project

Seven source files, flat, no build system, plus the published checkpoints in
`ckpt/`.

| file | lines | role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/core.c` | ~4500 | the text engine: a header and its implementation in one file |
| `app/main.c` | ~670 | the command line for it, six verbs |
| `app/yolo.c` | ~4700 | the picture engine, the same way, with its own command line under `YOLO_MAIN` |
| `app/vulk.c` | ~4300 | the Vulkan backend for both engines' seams; compiled in by `--vulkan` |
| `test/test.c` | ~1500 | unit tests over both engines' internals |
| `test/test.py` | ~780 | comparison against Hugging Face `transformers` |
| `util/make.py` | ~280 | install, build, test, run, bench, clean |
| `util/tune.py` | ~1700 | fine tuning on the reference side, the caveman rule engine, and the heretic abliteration pass |
| `data/tune.jsonl` | 202 rows | the tuning corpus |
| `ckpt/` | — | the checkpoints; `ckpt/lfm2.5-2.6b-a` is the one this engine runs |

Sections 2 through 9 are about the text engine. The picture engine has its own
tour in section 10; it shares this file's conventions and nothing else, because
a picture model and a language model have no kernel, no store and no vocabulary
in common. Section 11 is the Vulkan backend, which is neither engine and fills
the seam of both.

`app/main.c` and `test/test.c` each begin with `#include "core.c"`. That is
deliberate: the project has no header file, so the engine carries its own
interface at the top of its implementation, guarded by `ILL_CORE_INCLUDED`.
Each front end is a single translation unit, which lets the compiler inline the
whole engine and lets the tests reach the internals they are testing.

Build any of it with one command:

```sh
cc -std=c11 -O3 -march=native app/main.c -o app_main -lm -pthread
```

`util/make.py build` does exactly that, after probing which flags the compiler
accepts.

## 2. What the architecture computes

The Liquid architecture — `model_type: "lfm2"` — is a hybrid stack. Every layer
has the same two-step shape:

```
h  <-  h + operator(rmsnorm(h, operator_norm))
h  <-  h + swiglu(rmsnorm(h, ffn_norm))
```

What differs is the operator, which the checkpoint chooses per layer through
`layer_types` (or the older `full_attn_idxs`).

### The attention operator

Grouped query attention with rotary positions, and one detail that is easy to
miss: **each query head and each key head is RMS normalised before the
rotation**, using a gain of `head_dim` values shared across heads.

```
q = rmsnorm(q_proj(x)  reshaped to heads,      q_layernorm)
k = rmsnorm(k_proj(x)  reshaped to key heads,  k_layernorm)
v = v_proj(x)
q, k = rope(q, k, position)
y = out_proj( softmax(q k^T / sqrt(head_dim), causal) v )
```

There are no biases anywhere in the block, and no separate `o_proj` — the
output projection is named `out_proj`.

### The convolution operator

The liquid short convolution. One projection produces three stacked halves; two
of them gate a depthwise causal convolution over the third.

```
B, C, x = split(in_proj(h), 3)          # each model_dim wide
y = conv1d_causal(B * x, taps)          # depthwise, conv_L_cache taps
y = out_proj(C * y)
```

The convolution is causal and zero padded, so with `L` taps

```
y[t][c] = sum_{j<L} taps[c][j] * u[t - (L-1) + j][c]        u = B * x
```

and positions before the start of the sequence read as zero. Between calls the
last `L - 1` values per channel are the entire recurrent state. That is what
makes these layers cheap: no cache that grows with context.

### The rest

- **Feed forward**: `w2( silu(w1 x) * w3 x )`. The engine reads the inner width
  from the shape of `w1` rather than recomputing the `block_auto_adjust_ff_dim`
  rule, so a checkpoint that disagrees with the formula still loads.
- **Norms**: RMS norm throughout — `x * rsqrt(mean(x^2) + eps) * gain` — reduced
  in f32, exactly as the reference does it.
- **Rotary**: the half-rotation form. `cos` and `sin` are indexed modulo
  `head_dim / 2`, and element `i` pairs with element `i + head_dim / 2`.
- **Output**: a final `embedding_norm`, then the output projection, which is
  tied to the embedding table unless the checkpoint ships `lm_head.weight`.

### What the two operators cost

For a 32-layer, 2560-wide model, per token:

| | parameters read | state per token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| attention layer | 16.4 M | `2 * kv_heads * head_dim` floats, grows with context |
| convolution layer | 26.2 M | `(L - 1) * model_dim` floats, fixed |
| feed forward | 62.9 M | none |

The feed forward dominates the arithmetic; the attention layers dominate the
memory that grows.

## 3. The public API

Four objects and about thirty calls. Everything is in part 1 of `app/core.c`.

```c
IllModel     weights, architecture, vocabulary — read only once loaded
IllState     one sequence: caches and every scratch buffer a step touches
IllVocab     the tokenizer
IllSampler   the token choice policy, plus the history a penalty needs
```

A whole session:

```c
IllPlan   plan;
IllModel *model;
IllState *state;
float    *logits;

ill_plan_init(&plan);
plan.model_path  = "path/to/lfm2.5-2.6b-a";
plan.weight_type = ILL_TYPE_Q8;          /* or ILL_TYPE_KEEP */
ill_model_load(&model, &plan);
ill_state_make(&state, model, 4096);

IllBatch batch = { prompt_ids, prompt_len, 0 };
ill_model_apply(model, state, &batch, &logits);
/* logits now points at one row of vocab_size floats, owned by the state */

ill_state_free(state);
ill_model_free(model);
```

Rules that hold everywhere:

- Every call that can fail returns `IllResult`; `ill_result_text` names it.
- Every constructor takes its output by pointer and leaves it `NULL` on
  failure, so an error path never frees a half built object.
- `ill_model_apply` appends to the sequence held in the state. Set
  `batch.every` to get a row of logits per token instead of one for the last.
- The returned `logits` pointer is engine owned and stays valid until the next
  call on that state.
- A model is read only after loading, so several states may share one model.
  A state belongs to one thread at a time.
- Buffer sized calls — `ill_vocab_encode`, `ill_vocab_decode`,
  `ill_vocab_prompt` — always report the full requirement, so calling once with
  a limit of zero sizes the buffer and calling again fills it.

## 4. Inside core.c

Fifteen parts, each layered on the ones above it.

### part 1 — public interface

Types, result codes, and prototypes. Nothing else in the file appears here, so
this section is the contract.

### part 2 — platform layer

Everything the engine wants from the operating system, in one place: aligned
allocation, whole-file mapping, a monotonic clock, a core count, and a thread
pool. Three ports — POSIX, Windows, and a fallback that reads files with
`fopen` and runs single threaded — so the rest of the file never sees an
`#ifdef` for the host.

The thread pool deserves a note. A decode step issues a few hundred parallel
regions, so a mutex round trip per region would dominate the step. Instead the
pool runs one task at a time and hands it out through a rising epoch counter:

- The caller writes the task, resets the claim and done counters, then bumps
  the epoch with a release store.
- Workers spin on the epoch with an acquire load, which is what publishes the
  task fields.
- Each worker, and the calling thread, claims chunks with an atomic
  fetch-and-add until the chunks run out, so uneven work self balances.
- The caller spins until every worker has reported done, then returns.

Workers back off from `pause` to `sched_yield` after a spin budget. If the
toolchain has no C11 atomics, `ILL_WITH_THREADS` is zero and `ill_pool_fork`
runs the chunks inline — the same code, one lane.

### part 3 — number formats

f16 and bf16 conversion in both directions, written by hand so that no
compiler intrinsic is required and so the round trips are testable. Widening is
exact; narrowing rounds to nearest even.

### part 4 — vector vocabulary

The one idea that keeps the kernels short. A dozen inline functions — `zero`,
`wide`, `load`, `save`, `add`, `mul`, `fma`, `sum`, `abs`, `max`, `top`, plus
`bf16` and `f16` loaders — are defined four times, once per target:

| target | `ILL_VW` | type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AVX-512 | 16 | `__m512` |
| AVX2 + FMA | 8 | `__m256` |
| NEON | 4 | `float32x4_t` |
| plain C | 1 | `float` |

Every kernel below is written once against this vocabulary. The width-1
instantiation is not a separate reference implementation that could drift — it
is the same source, compiled with a vector width of one. `make.py test --no-simd`
runs the full suite through it, and `make.py test --portable` runs it at width 8,
so agreement between widths is checked rather than assumed.

### part 5 — block quantisation

q8 is symmetric per-block: 32 signed bytes share one f32 scale. Blocks run along
the input dimension, so a dot product walks weight scales and activation scales
in the same order.

The dot product accumulates integer products into a *float* vector scaled per
block, rather than reducing each block on its own:

```
acc = fma( cvt_f32(madd_i16(w_block, a_block)), scale_w * scale_a, acc )
```

That leaves exactly one horizontal reduction per output row. On AVX-512BW a
32-value block widens to precisely one register of int16, so a block costs a
single multiply-add.

q4 is the same block with the values at half the width, two to a byte: sixteen
bytes and one scale where q8 spends thirty-two and one. The block's largest
value is placed exactly on -8, so all sixteen levels are used and the scale
carries a sign. A block lifts straight into a register on any machine with
vectors, never through memory. Where the lift writes bytes — reading a row
back, and the ragged block at the end of one — it writes the signed weights the
q8 dot reads; where it lifts into a register for the paired dot it leaves the
stored code, 0..15, alone, because that dot wants an unsigned operand and takes
the eight back out against the activations instead.

Where VNNI is present the loop takes blocks in pairs instead, because two
blocks are 64 bytes and that is one 512 bit register whole:

```
q8: acc = fma( cvt_f32(dpbusd(|w_pair|, a_pair * sign(w_pair))), sv, acc )
q4: acc = fma( cvt_f32(dpbusd(codes, a_pair) - dpbusd(8, a_pair)), sv, acc )
```

`vpdpbusd` folds four byte products into a lane against `vpmaddwd`'s two, and
it reads bytes directly, so the two widenings disappear as well — which on a
host bound by instruction issue is the larger half of the saving. Its left
operand is unsigned. q8 therefore sends the weights in as magnitudes and moves
their sign onto the activations; AVX-512 has no `vpsignb`, so that move is
`vpmovb2m` and a masked negate. **q4 has nothing to move**, because a nibble is
already unsigned: it sends the stored codes and subtracts `8 * sum(a)` per
lane, which is the same instruction against a constant eight. The integers are
the same either way — four bytes to a lane means the total never leaves int32 —
so this is three operations rather than four for the same answer.

Lanes 0..7 carry the low block and lanes 8..15 the high one, so the two scales
reach the multiply-add as one register, `sv`. That register is built by
broadcasting each consecutive pair of scales out of memory with a permute and
multiplying the weight side by the activation side — five operations where two
scalar multiplies and an insert were nine — and the weight side is the same for
every activation row in a tile, so it is lifted out of the tile loop.
`IllQScale` is the carrier: a `__m512` here, and the two floats themselves
everywhere else, where the pair folds back into two single block steps in the
same order. Only a VNNI build's output moves.

The one thing in `dense` that is not arithmetic is `ILL_AHEAD`, a prefetch a
kilobyte ahead of the block the dot is on. Rows are contiguous, so running off
the end of one reaches into the next; running off the end of the plane is
architecturally a no-op rather than a fault, which is why the loops do not
test for it.

### part 6 — json reader

A compact DOM. Every node is an index into one flat array and every string is
an offset into one text pool, so a document frees with two calls. `\uXXXX`
escapes fold to UTF-8, surrogate pairs included. Trailing commas are rejected;
this is JSON, not a configuration language.

It is used three times: `config.json`, the safetensors headers, and
`tokenizer.json` — which for a 65k vocabulary is several megabytes and the
reason the reader is written to allocate in geometric steps rather than per
node.

### part 7 — safetensors store

Maps every shard and indexes the tensors inside them. Shards are found by
`model.safetensors.index.json` if present, then by `model.safetensors`, then by
scanning the folder for `*.safetensors` in sorted order.

Nothing is copied. A slab is a pointer into the mapping, so a 5 GiB checkpoint
costs address space and page cache rather than a 5 GiB read — which is why
loading bf16 weights takes about a tenth of a second.

### part 8 — compute kernels

`IllPlane` is a linear weight: cells, optional q8 scales, a format, and the two
extents. Every kernel takes planes and f32 activations.

The one that decides throughput is `dense`. It streams a weight row once and
fuses it against up to four activation rows:

```
for each output row r:
    for each column block j:
        w = load(W[r] + j)
        for t in 0..T-1:
            acc[t] = fma(w, load(X[t] + j), acc[t])
```

`T` is a literal at every instantiation — the body is a macro expanded for
T = 1, 2, 3, 4 and for each stored format — so the accumulators stay in
registers rather than spilling to an array. Tiling matters: at T = 1 a 256
token prefill would stream the whole model 256 times. Wider tiles were measured
and were slower, because four activation rows of a 2560-wide model already fill
L1.

The rest are direct: RMS norm reduced in f32, SwiGLU, softmax with the standard
peak subtraction, a fused multiply-add accumulate for the attention value mix,
and a plain dot product.

### part 9 — backend seam

The forward pass never calls a kernel. It calls through `IllBackend`:

```c
setup   close   width
dense   rmsnorm  swiglu   rope   attend   conv1d
```

Nine function pointers and an opaque `inner`. The CPU backend fills them with
the part 8 kernels spread over the thread pool, splitting `dense` over output
rows, `attend` over `(token, head)` pairs, `conv1d` over channels, and the
elementwise stages over tokens. Below `ILL_FORK_FLOOR` multiply-adds it runs
inline, because the handshake would cost more than the work it spreads.

`ill_backend_join` registers another implementation; `--backend NAME` selects
it. That is the whole extension point.

### part 10 — model load

Three passes. Read `config.json` into an `IllArch`. Bind every tensor into an
`IllPlane` or, for the small ones, widen it to an owned f32 vector. Optionally
repack the large planes to q8, in parallel across the thread pool.

Two habits keep this section honest:

- Extents are checked against the checkpoint, and a mismatch names the tensor
  and both shapes rather than failing silently.
- Names are tried with and without the `model.` prefix, so a bare `Lfm2Model`
  export loads as readily as an `Lfm2ForCausalLM` one.

Every allocation the model owns goes through `ill_model_own`, which appends it
to one list. `ill_model_free` walks that list. There is no other ownership rule
to remember, which is why the error path can be a single `goto undo`.

### part 11 — model state

One sequence. It holds what carries between steps:

- the key/value cache, laid out `[layer][kv head][position][head_dim]` so one
  head's keys are contiguous across positions, which is the order the attention
  dot product walks them in;
- the convolution window, `[layer][channel][L-1]`;

and every scratch buffer the forward pass touches, sized once from the batch
width, so a step allocates nothing.

`ill_state_crop` rewinds the sequence. It reports `ILL_STATE` rather than
guessing when a model has convolution layers: their window is recurrent, and a
partial rewind cannot be undone without replaying the sequence.

### part 12 — forward pass

The stack itself, and it reads like the equations in section 2. Chunking lives
here: `ill_model_apply` splits a batch into pieces of at most `batch_span` and
calls `ill_stack_run` on each, asking for logits only where the caller wants
them, so a long prompt never materialises a logit row it will not use.

Rotary tables are computed per chunk, not cached for the whole window: 256
positions of `head_dim` floats is small, and computing the phase as
`fmod(position * inv_freq, 2 pi)` in double keeps precision at position 100,000
where a float phase would have lost several bits.

### part 13 — vocabulary

Byte level BPE read straight from `tokenizer.json`. Three tables do the work:
pieces indexed by id, a piece-to-id map, and a merge map keyed by the *pair of
ids* being joined. Because every merge result is itself a vocabulary entry, the
inner loop never touches a string — it walks ids.

Encoding runs in four stages:

1. **added tokens** — matched literally, longest first, splitting the input.
   The set is a byte trie whose first byte is a 256-entry head table, so a
   position that starts no added token is rejected by one indexed read; below
   the head a node's children are a linked list, because the depth reached is
   one or two for anything that is not a real match. `ill_vocab_twine` builds
   it at load and `ill_vocab_reach` walks it.
2. **pre-tokenization** — the GPT-2 or Llama-3 alternation, transcribed in
   order rather than run through a regex engine. Which one is detected from the
   `Split` pattern in `tokenizer.json`.
3. **byte encoding** — each byte becomes one symbol through the GPT-2 alphabet,
   looked up once at load into a 256-entry table of ids.
4. **merging** — a binary heap of candidate pairs over a doubly linked list of
   symbols. Popped candidates are validated against the current ids before
   being applied, which is what makes stale heap entries harmless. This keeps
   long unbroken runs — base64, a long identifier — near linear rather than
   quadratic.

Character classes are the one approximation in the engine, and it is a
deliberate one: carrying the Unicode database would dwarf the rest of the file,
so runes below `0x80` use the exact ASCII rule and runes above it are letters
unless they fall in a listed range of spaces, punctuation, or symbols. The
ranges cover the blocks that appear in ordinary prose. `TODO.md` records the
gap.

Chat prompts are shaped by detecting `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` in the
vocabulary rather than by evaluating the Jinja `chat_template`, which would mean
carrying a template engine. `--raw` bypasses shaping entirely.

### part 14 — sampler

Filters in the order that keeps each one meaningful: repetition penalty on raw
logits, then temperature, then the candidate cuts — top-k, then min-p, then
top-p — then one draw from what survives. Temperature zero short circuits to an
argmax without sorting. The generator is splitmix64, so a seed replays exactly
on any host.

### part 15 — facade

Result names. Short by design: if this section were long, the API would be
wrong.

---

## 5. The command line

```
app_main info      describe the checkpoint and the load plan
app_main tokens    encode --prompt, or decode --tokens
app_main generate  continue a prompt and stream the completion
app_main chat      interactive conversation on stdin
app_main logits    write logits, the hook test/test.py compares against
app_main bench     time prefill and decode
app_main perplexity  score a text, so an accuracy trade has a number
```

`app_main help` lists every flag. Three are worth knowing:

- `--quant q8` repacks at load: half the memory, roughly double the decode
  rate. `--quant q4` halves it again for 1.23x q8's decode, at an accuracy
  cost that is invisible on prose and severe on text the model is sure about.
- `--draft N` proposes `N` tokens from the context and verifies them in the
  same pass, which is worth about a quarter on work whose answer quotes its
  question and nothing on work that invents every token. Greedy only, and the
  text is byte for byte the text without it.
- `--raw` feeds the prompt verbatim instead of shaping a chat turn around it.
- `--tokens 1,2,3` supplies ids directly, which is how the engine is exercised
  against a checkpoint whose tokenizer it cannot read.

`logits` also takes `--every` for a row per token and `--stream --prefill N` to
feed the first `N` tokens as one batch and the rest one at a time. That second
mode exists so the test suite can check the caches rather than only the maths.

`perplexity` reads a text from stdin or `--prompt` and reports the mean
negative log likelihood it assigns to each token given everything before it,
in nats, in bits, and as its exponent. It scores the text as it stands — no
chat template is wrapped around it even without `--raw`, because the template's
own tokens are not what the number is for. It exists so that a change which
trades accuracy for speed can be judged rather than argued about; the cost of
`--quant q8` is the first thing it was pointed at.

---

## 6. How correctness is established

Three layers, each catching what the others cannot.

**`test/test.c` — 119 unit checks.** Number formats against their definitions;
the JSON reader against nested documents, escapes, surrogates, and eight
malformed inputs; every kernel against a plain-C restatement of the same
arithmetic written independently in the test, at every tile width the dispatch
instantiates; the paired q8 dot against the two single block dots it stands
for; rotary, attention, and convolution against direct transcriptions of their
equations, including the convolution window carried across calls; the thread
pool for exact-once execution over many widths and repeated forks; the
pre-tokenizer chunk by chunk; the merge heap; the row normaliser a score is
built on; the rule that decides when a streamed character is whole; the scan
that drafts a continuation from the context; the q4 pack and both of its
lifts; and the sampler for seed replay,
nucleus containment, and repetition demotion.

**`test/test.py` — 19 comparisons against `transformers`.** Small Liquid
checkpoints are built with random weights and run through both implementations.
The matrix covers attention-only, convolution-only, and hybrid stacks; grouped
and multi query attention; tied and untied heads; wide and biased kernels;
non-round widths; f32, f16, and bf16 storage; prefill chunked at widths 1, 3, 7,
and 64; streaming decode from four different prefill lengths; 300 positions; one
thread against four; q8 repacking judged on agreement rather than distance; and
tokenizer agreement over twenty awkward strings for both split flavours, plus a
decode round trip.

Random initialisation leaves every norm gain at 1.0, which would hide a gain
loaded from the wrong tensor, so the fixture randomises them. Token id 0 is
avoided because the reference zeroes the padding embedding, which drives the
whole stack to zero and would hide real differences.

Against f32 checkpoints the engine matches to 2e-7 relative — float32 rounding.

**Sanitizers.** `make.py test --sanitize` builds with AddressSanitizer and
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Both suites run clean, including leak detection.

A real checkpoint is tested the same way: `make.py test --model PATH` adds a
logits comparison and a tokenizer comparison against it, for 25 comparisons in
all. The published checkpoints ship in `ckpt/` (`ckpt/lfm2.5-0.4b-e`, `ckpt/lfm2.5-2.6b-a`), 
with the smallest the default, so this runs by default, and it adds two further checks 
the synthetic suite cannot make:

- **throughput** — the engine's `bench` beside transformers doing the same
  shape of work: one batch of 256 tokens, then 64 single-token steps with the
  cache carried, both at bf16 and the same thread count. Quoting the engine's
  q8 against the reference's bf16 would fold a weight width difference into
  what looks like an engine difference.
- **greedy behaviour** — continuations from the same ids under identical greedy
  settings, compared on the shared prefix of ids. The comparison is on ids, not
  on text: `generate` emits decoded text, and re-encoding text to recover ids
  is not a round trip — the tokenizer can segment the same string differently —
  so re-encoding would report divergence the engines never produced. Where a
  greedy chain parts is one draw from a lottery on both sides — the reference
  primed one token at a time parts from itself somewhere too — so the engine is
  allowed to follow half as far as the reference follows itself before it is
  called wrong.

A missing checkpoint folder is a skip, not a failure: the synthetic suite is
the parity argument and runs without it.

---

## 7. Where the time goes

Decode is memory bound. One token reads every weight once, so the rate is
bytes divided by achievable bandwidth, and nothing else matters much. That is
why q8 nearly doubles it and why threads help until bandwidth saturates.

Prefill is arithmetic bound. `2 * parameters * tokens` FLOPs, and the tile in
`dense` decides how close to peak you get.

On the published 2.6B checkpoint at q8, four cores at 2.80 GHz, AVX-512 with
VNNI — the `xeon-2.8` host in `CHANGES.md`'s standing results:

| | weights | prefill, 256 tok | decode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| q8 | 2.83 GiB | 32.2 tok/s | 9.7 tok/s |
| q4 | 1.57 GiB | 30.0 tok/s | 11.9 tok/s |

Decode there is 32.5 GB/s of weight traffic against a 36.6 GB/s bare memory
sweep — 89% of what the host can fetch, so the decode kernel has about a tenth
left in it and everything after that has to read fewer bytes or produce more
than one token per read. Prefill is 88 G multiply-adds a second and is bound by
instruction issue, not by memory: its weight stream is well under the sweep.

If you are profiling a change, the order of what to look at is: the `dense`
inner loop, then the attention score loop at long context, then everything else
together. In q8 the inner loop is `ill_q8_pair`, which takes two 32-value
blocks at once because that is one 512 bit register; `ill_q8_step` is the
single block form it falls back to for an odd trailing block and on
instruction sets without VNNI. In q4 it is `ill_q4_dot`, over the pair
`ill_q4_open` has just unpacked into a register.

The numbers above are 1.6.0's and the kernel has moved since: what 1.9.0 took
out of that inner loop is in `CHANGES.md`, and the 89% figure is a floor for
the kernel the engine has now.

---

## 8. Extending the engine

### A new backend

Fill an `IllBackend`, call `ill_backend_join(&mine)` before `ill_model_load`,
and pass `--backend mine`. The nine entry points are listed in section 4. Weight
planes point at mapped host memory, so a device backend uploads them in `setup`
and keeps the device handles in `inner`.

The seam was drawn where it is because these six operations are the only
arithmetic the stack performs, and each is large enough that a per-call
dispatch is free. **The second half of that sentence is the one that turned out
to be conditional.** `app/vulk.c` (section 11) is the worked example, and what
it found is that a dispatch is free at prefill widths and is not free at all
for a single token: the seam passes host pointers, so every call also uploads
its inputs and downloads its outputs, and a decode step is a hundred-odd
round trips whose arithmetic is microseconds each. Read section 11 before
drawing a second device backend against this seam.

### A new weight format

Add the enum value, a loader in the vector vocabulary, a case in
`ILL_DENSE_TYPED`, a case in `ill_plane_row`, and a branch in
`ill_model_plane`. Nothing else knows the difference.

A *block* format is more than that, because it does not read through the f32
vocabulary at all: q4 is the worked example — `ill_q4_pack`, a lift, its own
dense body, and `ill_model_pack` told which format it is packing into. If the
format is narrower than a byte, make the lift produce a register the dot reads
rather than a buffer it reloads. That single choice is the difference between
q4 decoding 1.23x faster than q8 and 1.8x slower; the entry for 1.6.0 has the
three measurements.

### A new tokenizer family

`ill_vocab_read` reports `ILL_VOCAB` for anything that is not byte level BPE
rather than approximating it. A Unigram or WordPiece model would slot in beside
it as another `model.type` branch with its own encode path; the piece tables and
the added-token scan are already shared.

### A new architecture in the family

`IllArch` and the per-layer `IllBlock` are the two structures to widen. A new
operator is a third `kind` in `IllBlock`, a branch in `ill_stack_run`, and its
own cache in `IllState`. The two operators already there are the pattern.

---

## 9. Naming conventions

They are mechanical, so the code reads at an even pace.

- **Types** are `Ill` plus a short noun: `IllModel`, `IllState`, `IllPlane`,
  `IllBlock`, `IllBatch`, `IllVocab`, `IllPlan`, `IllPool`.
- **Functions** are `ill_<module>_<verb>`. The module is the noun the call acts
  on; the verb comes from a small fixed set so opposites pair by shape:
  `make`/`free`, `open`/`close`, `load`/`free`, `setup`/`close`, `push`/`pull`,
  `note`/`wipe`, `find`/`name`.
- **Fields** are one or two short words of similar weight, and related fields
  rhyme: `model_dim` and `inner_dim`; `head_count` and `group_count`;
  `layer_count`, `attn_count`, `conv_count`; `begin_token` and `end_token`;
  `fill` and `span`; `gate`, `rise`, `fall` for the three feed forward planes.
- **Result codes** are one word: `ILL_OK`, `ILL_ARGS`, `ILL_ALLOC`, `ILL_FILE`,
  `ILL_PARSE`, `ILL_SHAPE`, `ILL_MODEL`, `ILL_VOCAB`, `ILL_LIMIT`, `ILL_STATE`.
- **Backend operations** keep their standard names — `dense`, `rmsnorm`,
  `swiglu`, `rope`, `attend`, `conv1d` — because an implementer should
  recognise them on sight, and consistency of form is the rhythm that matters
  at a seam.

Comments explain the decision, not the statement. If a line needs a comment to
say what it does, it is the line that should change.

## 10. The picture engine: inside yolo.c

`app/yolo.c` runs an Ultralytics yolo26 checkpoint as it is published. Not a
converted one: a `.pt` is a zip holding a pickled module tree and its raw fp16
storages, and the engine reads that directly. There is no export step, no
second format and no Python in the path.

It is the same shape as `core.c` — one translation unit, a public interface at
the top guarded by `YOLO_INCLUDED`, everything below it private, and layers
bottom-up where a layer may depend only on the ones beneath it. Include it to
use it as a library; define `YOLO_MAIN` to get a command line as well.

### The layers

| layer | what is in it |
| --- | --- |
| 1 platform | status codes, the detail line, the arena, byte reads, half to float |
| 2 planes | NCHW float planes over arena memory |
| 3 backend | `YoloBackend`, the nine operations an accelerator would fill |
| 4 kernels | the CPU backend: convolution, transposed convolution, pooling, resizing, activation, the matrix multiply |
| 5 store | the zip reader, the pickle reader, and the storage table under them |
| 6 graph | the pickled module tree turned into runnable nodes, with batch norm folded into the convolution above it |
| 7 forward | the layer plan and the feature maps the head reads |
| 8 head | the two detection branches, anchors, box decode, suppression, masks, keypoints |
| 9 pictures | stb and PNM, letterboxing, lifting a result back to the source |
| 10 api | model, options, session, result |
| 11 cli | under `YOLO_MAIN` |

### Reading the graph rather than rebuilding it

The usual way to run a `.pt` outside Python is to read its `state_dict` and
rebuild the architecture from the model's yaml, applying the depth and width
scale table for the size letter. This engine does not. **Every module in a
torch checkpoint already carries its class name, the channel counts it was
constructed with, its kernel size, stride, padding and groups, and its `f`/`i`
wiring** — because `torch.save` pickles the object graph, not the weights
alone. Re-deriving that from the yaml is guesswork about a computation the
checkpoint has already done, and it is why the nano, small and extra-large
checkpoints all load through the same code with nothing keyed on the size.

The pickle is **read, never executed**. A `GLOBAL` is a pair of names. Four of
them mean something to a checkpoint — `collections.OrderedDict`,
`torch._utils._rebuild_tensor_v2`, `_rebuild_parameter`, and a storage's type
in a persistent id — and are turned into the value they stand for. Every other
becomes an object carrying its class name and its state, which is exactly what
the graph layer reads. Nothing constructs a class and nothing calls a function
the file names.

One rewrite happens on the way through: a convolution followed by a batch norm
becomes one convolution with a bias, which is the identity

```
bn(conv(x)) = conv'(x),   w' = w · γ/√(σ²+ε),   b' = (b−μ)·γ/√(σ²+ε) + β
```

and is what ultralytics itself does before it predicts.

### The two heads

yolo26 ships two copies of its detection branches. `cv2`/`cv3` are trained one
to many, so several cells fire on one object and suppression picks between
them. `one2one_cv2`/`one2one_cv3` are trained one to one, so the top scoring
cells are the answer and there is nothing to suppress — the NMS-free path the
architecture is known for.

**`yolo predict` reads the one-to-many pair unless it is told otherwise**, and
so does this engine. `nms_free_flag` in `YoloOptions`, or `--nms-free` on the
command line, reads the other. Both are implemented, because a parity run has
to be able to ask for either.

`reg_max` is 1 on every published yolo26, so the distribution focal layer is an
identity and the box branch says its four distances outright. `yolo_edge_value`
still carries the distribution form, so a v8 or v11 checkpoint loads and runs
rather than being read wrongly and producing plausible boxes.

### The seam an accelerator fills

Every arithmetic the forward pass does goes through `YoloBackend`: nine
function pointers, and a CPU table that is the reference implementation of
them. `yolo_model_backend_set` points a model at another table. Nothing above
layer 4 knows which one is in play, and nothing in layers 5 through 11 does
arithmetic of its own.

### Where a parity run goes wrong

Three things had to be matched rather than improved on, and each of them is the
kind of thing that looks like noise until it is not.

**The letterbox pads to a stride multiple, not a square.** `yolo predict` on a
checkpoint sets `auto=True`, so a 1280 by 720 picture becomes 640 by 384 and a
810 by 1080 one becomes 480 by 640 with no padding at all. Padding out to a
square changes the anchor grid, which changes every score in the last digit.

**The resize is OpenCV's fixed point, not a float bilinear.** OpenCV quantises
the two interpolation weights to 2048ths, drops four bits off each row before
weighing it, keeps two fractional bits through the sum and rounds those away.
Doing the arithmetic in one wider step and rounding once — which is more
accurate — is wrong by a unit on about a tenth of the cells, and that carried
to a hundredth of a logit at the head and a different score on a marginal
detection.

**A classifier's shaping goes through Pillow, which antialiases.** Shrinking a
1080 pixel side to 224, Pillow weighs a five-wide window rather than the two
nearest pixels. The two-tap resize puts the right label on `bus.jpg` with the
wrong confidence, 0.77 where the reference says 0.52, because the aliasing it
leaves behind is the high-frequency detail a classifier reads.

There is a fourth that is not a difference of algorithm but of decoder: **stb
and OpenCV do not agree on a JPEG to the last unit**. A parity run compares on
the same decoded pixels — write the picture out as PNG or PNM first — or it
measures the two decoders as much as the engine.

### Naming

The same rules as section 9, with `Yolo` and `yolo_` in place of `Ill` and
`ill_`: `yolo_model_open`, `yolo_session_run`, `yolo_plane_face`,
`yolo_frame_fit`. Field suffixes carry the same meanings — `_count` a quantity,
`_size` a dimension, `_limit` a cap, `_list` an array, `_room` scratch, `_flag`
a boolean, `_sheet` a weight matrix.

One name is worth pointing at because it is load-bearing and not obvious: an
**oriented** pick keeps its centre in `left`/`top` and its size in
`right`/`bottom`, because a rotated box has no corners to put there.

## 11. The Vulkan backend: inside vulk.c

`app/vulk.c` is neither engine. It fills `IllBackend`'s six operations and
`YoloBackend`'s nine, from one file, over Vulkan, and a build takes whichever
half it wants: `VULK_NO_PICTURE` leaves out the half that serves `app/yolo.c`,
`VULK_NO_TEXT` the half that serves `app/core.c`. It is one file rather than
two because the halves that differ are fourteen compute shaders and the half
that is the same — device, memory, pipeline, dispatch — is about two thousand
lines that neither engine should own twice.

```sh
python3 util/make.py build --vulkan
./build/app_main generate --model ckpt/lfm2.5-2.6b-a --backend vulkan --prompt "..."
./build/app_yolo ckpt/yolo26/yolo26n.pt photo.png --device ""
```

A device is chosen by preference — discrete, then integrated, then software —
unless a substring of its name is given, as `--device` for the picture engine
and as `ILL_VULKAN_DEVICE` for the text one, which has no room for a second
flag beside `--backend`. The preference is wrong exactly once, on a laptop
where the integrated part shares the memory the model already sits in, and
naming the device is how that is said.

### What it refuses

**A dependency.** There is no `vulkan.h`, no SDK, no `-lvulkan`, and no second
build step. Part 1 declares the two dozen structures and fifty entry points
the file uses against the published ABI and opens the loader with `dlopen`. A
`--vulkan` build on a host with no Vulkan compiles, runs, and reports the
backend unavailable; the caller keeps the CPU one. Two ABI conventions carry
the weight and are written down rather than assumed: dispatchable handles are
pointers and non-dispatchable handles are always 64 bits, on a 32 bit host as
much as a 64 bit one; and every structure begins with a tag the driver reads.

**A shader compiler.** Part 3 is a SPIR-V assembler and part 4 writes the
kernels against it, so the shaders are built at run time and there is no blob in
the tree. Two shortcuts keep it readable. No phi nodes: every value that
crosses a branch is an `OpVariable` in the Function storage class, which is
what glslang emits before its own mem2reg pass and what a driver turns back
into registers — it removes the hard part of emitting structured control flow
by hand and costs nothing. One buffer shape: every binding is
`struct { float cell[]; }` in the Uniform storage class with the BufferBlock
decoration, which is how a storage buffer is spelled in SPIR-V 1.0 and
therefore works on a Vulkan 1.0 driver; integers ride through `OpBitcast`, and
the push constants are sixteen raw words read the same way. One descriptor
layout and one push range serve all fourteen kernels.

**Quantised weights on the device.** A plane is widened to f32 on the way
across, through `ill_plane_row` — the engine's own widening — so the device is
handed exactly the values the CPU dot product would have reconstructed. It is
exact and it gives back the memory that q4 exists to save: the 2.6B
checkpoint's 1.57 GiB at q4 is 10.0 GiB of f32 on the device. `TODO.md` item
52 is the packed form.

### The parts

```
 1  abi         what this file declares of Vulkan, and the loader
 2  device      instance, queue, memory types, buffers, submission
 3  spirv       the assembler the kernels are written against
 4  kernels     the fourteen shaders
 5  pipelines   modules, layouts, descriptors, dispatch
 6  residence   device copies of host memory, and the weight cache
 7  open/close  choosing a device and standing it up
 8  vulk_op     one operation, end to end
 9  IllBackend  the text table
10  YoloBackend the picture table
11  probe       the comparison, under VULK_MAIN or VULK_PROBE
```

Three habits run through part 4 and are worth knowing before reading any one
kernel. **A dispatch is a grid stride loop**, because Vulkan guarantees only
65535 workgroups in a dimension and a vocabulary projection wants 65536 rows;
that makes the workgroup count a tuning knob rather than a correctness
requirement. **A workgroup is sixty-four invocations, everywhere** — the floor
Vulkan guarantees is 128, so 64 is safe on anything. **Reductions go through
workgroup memory**, not through a subgroup add, which would be faster on every
device that has one and would need a capability to probe for and fall back
from.

Two kernels are not restatements of the CPU's.

**Attention streams.** The CPU writes the whole score row, softmaxes it, and
mixes; that needs `span` floats of scratch a worker, which the seam supplies as
`board`. A device would need `tokens * heads * span` — 256 MiB at a 512 token
prefill with 32 heads and a 4096 window, for a step whose output is 4 MiB. So
the device kernel takes one workgroup to a `(token, head)` pair, walks the
causal span in chunks of sixty-four, and keeps a running maximum and a running
total, both rescaled whenever the maximum moves, with the partial mix living in
the output row. Same answer, one pass, no scratch, and `board` unused.

**Convolution is direct.** The CPU lowers a patch matrix and multiplies,
because a contiguous stream is what a compiler vectorises. On a device the
lowering is nine reads and nine writes of the whole feature map for a 3x3, all
through memory, where the direct form reads the input nine times out of cache
and writes the output once. So `conv_room` answers zero: there is nothing to
lower into.

### What it costs, and what is in the way

Both seams pass host pointers. `dense` is handed a `const float *src` and a
`float *dst`; `conv_run` is handed two `YoloPlane`s over malloc memory. There
is nowhere in either interface to say that an answer is already on the device,
so **every operation uploads its inputs and downloads its outputs**. Weights
are cached by host pointer, because they are immutable after a model is loaded
and they are most of the bytes; activations are not, because nothing in the
seam says when the host last wrote them.

On `xeon-2.1`, yolo26n over a 320 picture is 139 submissions and 46.4 MiB moved
against 12 MiB of resident weights — a feature map crosses about four times,
out of the convolution that made it, into the concatenation, out again, into
the next convolution. One `logits` call on the 2.6B text checkpoint is 320
submissions and 196.7 MiB. Both engines' command lines will print those two
numbers.

So this backend wins on large shapes and loses on small ones, and on a
synchronous per-operation seam the submit-and-wait around a dispatch can cost
more than the arithmetic inside it. `TODO.md` item 51 is the fix, and it is a
change to `app/core.c` and `app/yolo.c` rather than to this file.

**Every number ever measured for this backend was taken on SwiftShader**, a
software rasterizer. None of them is a GPU rate. What a discrete card does with
these kernels is item 55, marked blocked.

### How it is checked

Part 11 compares each table against the CPU one over the same input and reports
through a callback, so `VULK_MAIN` (a standalone command) and `VULK_PROBE`
(`test/test.c`) share one copy of the comparison rather than two that could
drift. The tolerance is relative, not bit for bit, and deliberately: the dense
kernel folds sixty-four partial sums through a tree where the CPU walks the
row, and no reordering of floating point addition is exact. Everything agrees
to about a part in a million — 5.8e-07 on dense, 7.2e-07 on attention across
several chunks, 1.14e-06 over a whole 2.6B forward pass with the top fifty
logits in the same order, greedy text following the CPU's character for
character, and yolo26n reporting identical detections.

`ILL_VULKAN_STAGED` in the environment makes the memory picker refuse a
unified memory type and take the staging path instead — the one every discrete
card takes, and the one nothing on a host with only a software device would
otherwise run. The checks pass under it as well as without it.

A host with no device runs no comparisons, which the suite says rather than
failing: there is nothing to compare against.

### Naming

`vulk_` for the backend, `spv_` for the assembler, and the same field suffixes
as everywhere else. A few are worth pointing at. A **slab** is a device buffer
and the memory behind it; a **hold** is one cached upload of immutable host
memory, keyed on the pointer *and* the byte count, because the same address at
a different length is a different tensor. `sent` counts how many times the host
waited on the device and `moved` counts the bytes that crossed — the two
numbers that say whether the interface or the arithmetic is what is in the way.
